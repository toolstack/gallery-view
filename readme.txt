View posts in a gallery layout in the admin.

== Description ==

If your blog is primarily visually based?  Do you have featured images on all of your posts?  Is the default posts view less than intuitive for you?

Perhaps Gallery View might be able to help.

Gallery view adds a new view of your posts in a grid layout like a photographic contact sheet, letting you see your posts in a whole new way.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `gallery-view` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Gallery View can be accessed via the posts menu of the WordPress Admin under "Gallery".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

You'll get a checkerboard pattern displayed instead of the image.
